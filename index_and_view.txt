
--------------------INDEX--------------------

CREATE INDEX name_index ON employee (lname);

SELECT lname FROM employee WHERE SSN > 6000000;

0.0002 sec



DROP INDEX name_index ON employee;

SELECT lname FROM employee WHERE SSN > 6000000;

0.0009 sec


The first query was quicker and more efficient because it was using the index.
The index allows the database to find any record of "lname" without having to read all the tuples
in the "employee" relation.


--------------------VIEW--------------------

CREATE VIEW faculty AS
SELECT SSN, fname, lname
FROM employee;

When you try to insert a new value into the "faculty" view, mySQL shows success, however nothing is added. This is because
"faculty" is a view from the relation "employee" and this relation needs more than just SSN, fname, and lname for a tuple 
to be added. The view should update if you instert into the "employee" relation.
